# Veganism 
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Eabha and I am passionate about vegan food.   I love plant based products, such as protein bars and vegan curries. I love to bake delicious vegan recipes and find even better alternatives for meat and even make some of my own. My favourite dairy alternative is nutritional yeast, which is a replacement for cheese. It is a powder with a cheesy flavour that you can add to a variety of dishes, and it is also much healthier than cheese and contains essentail B vitamins.
